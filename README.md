PREMISE: This code only works in the Windows operating system. So it doesn't work on Linux, IOS, etc.
That said, it all works very simply. There is a link file inside the main folder called "Cursor Position.Ink", you can take this file and place it wherever you want on the computer to be able to start the application. 
Or you can directly open the .exe file named "Cursor-Position.exe".

Once started the program will display the position of your mouse in real time. 

From here you can click the "Enter" key on the keyboard to copy the coordinates to the computer clipboard and at the same time the copied coordinates will be saved in the text file "coordinates.txt" so you will always have them saved. 
Then to exit the program you just need to close the window using the appropriate button or press the "Esc" key on the keyboard.
